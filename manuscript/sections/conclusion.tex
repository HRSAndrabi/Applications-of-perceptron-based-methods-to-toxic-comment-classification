% Conclusion

In this paper, I consider the application of various machine-learning architectures and model-embedding methodologies to the task of toxic-comment classification. Consistent with prior research, my analysis identifies CNNs supplemented with GloVe embeddings to be the superior architecture for this task. While all tested architectures suffer from an erroneous tendency for discriminatory classification on the basis of sensitive identity biases, the choice of CNN architectures and GloVe embeddings marginally limits the extent of these biases.
